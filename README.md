# FOSSASIA Webfeeds

This is a feeder of the official FOSSASIA blog for static websites.  

The `index.html` file has a designed version that can be used as a standalone site. The `embed.html` version is designed to be embedded into websites. For example, one can make an iframe and display it on his or her site.
